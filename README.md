This is an example app used to showcase [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) testing. 

**Note:** this is a fork of the main example repository [https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink) that is constantly being updated.
This BitBucket fork is only to show how Cypress tests can run in parallel mode on BitBucket Pipelines. See [bitbucket-pipelines.yml](bitbucket-pipelines.yml) file.
